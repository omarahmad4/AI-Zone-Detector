# AI-Powered Security Camera Management System

## Description

This project is an AI-powered security camera management system built using Next.js. It provides a web-based interface for users to manage security cameras, define specific zones of interest within camera views, receive intelligent detection reports generated by AI models, and improve the accuracy of these detections over time. The core of the system is a dashboard that offers a centralized view of connected cameras, a log of recent detections, and tools for configuring and editing surveillance zones. The system integrates with Genkit AI to power the backend AI workflows, such as generating detection reports and improving model performance.
