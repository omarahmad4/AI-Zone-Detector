/**
 * @fileOverview This file is intended to house the Genkit flow for improving object detection accuracy.
 *
 * Currently, it's an empty placeholder as fine-tuning the YOLOv8 model is done directly with Python/OpenCV.
 * If future enhancements involve AI-driven analysis of images for improvement, the flow will be implemented here.
